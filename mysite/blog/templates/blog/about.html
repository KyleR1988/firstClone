      This is by first attempt at a blog clone project The website is
      built using Django 2.1, Bootstrap 4.1.3 and Python 3.7.1</p>
    <p>
      The build took around 3 weeks to complete as there were a few errors.
      Mostly just simple spelling mistakes. I also had to adapt my clone to
      Bootstarp 4.1.3 as the course from where I copied the project used bootstrap
      3.3.7. The major differnce was around the navbar, making sure it collapsed
      when and how it was suppoesed to. Also the icons in my project are not
      Glyphicons, I used Font Awesome as per the the Bootstrap Documnetation
      Suggestion

    <p>
      The way the website works is as follows:<br>
      &emsp; 1. The owner of the website can login and creat a new post <br>
      &emsp; 2. The post can then  be edited, trashed or published <br>
      &emsp; 3. The owner can add users to the site from the admin page <br>
      &emsp; 4. Users can add posts and comment on the posts available <br>
      &emsp; 5. Only users can apporve or delete comments on posts <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      All the comments and posts are stored in database tables. The users can
      access these tables through the admin login provided to them. From there,
      they can add othre users, add comments, delete posts and comments or
      approve posts and comments
    </p>

      Some other cool items I used were the Medium website style editor for
      input text. This I got from:
      <a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">MEDIUM EDITOR</a>.
      The color changing items I got from
      <a href=">http://codepen.io/thapliyalshivam/pen/dvgXVO">CodePen</a>.
